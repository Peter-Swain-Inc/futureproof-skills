## Step 1: Connect to FutureProof

```
FutureProof:connect(skill="instagram-caption-writer")
```

Use the returned `context`, `experiments`, `instructions`, and `recent_sessions` to personalise this session — including brand voice, ICA segments, historical engagement patterns, and any proven caption structures from prior experiments.

## Step 2: Get Input

Ask the user:
- **Post asset**: What is the visual? (image, carousel, Reel cover, graphic — share or describe it)
- **Post objective**: What is the single goal? (drive DM conversations, save/share velocity, link-in-bio clicks, follower growth, community engagement, product sales)
- **ICA segment**: Who specifically is this caption speaking to? (pull from FutureProof context if available; otherwise ask for demographics, psychographics, and current awareness stage)
- **Content pillar**: Which brand content pillar does this fall under? (educational, storytelling, social proof, promotional, entertainment)
- **Key message or CTA**: What is the one thing the reader should think, feel, or do after reading?
- **Constraints**: Any hashtag requirements, mandatory mentions, compliance language, character-length preferences, or tone directives?

If FutureProof context already contains brand voice guidelines, ICA profiles, or content pillars, confirm them with the user rather than re-asking.

## Step 3: Do the Work

### 3A: ICA-to-Caption Mapping

Before writing, build a brief **Caption Strategy Brief**:

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| ICA pain point addressed | Specific frustration or desire this post taps into |
| Awareness stage | Unaware → Problem-aware → Solution-aware → Product-aware → Most aware |
| Emotional hook type | Curiosity, fear of missing out, aspiration, belonging, controversy, relief |
| Scroll-stop mechanism | First line strategy matched to the visual asset |

### 3B: Caption Architecture

Construct the caption using a layered framework:

1. **Hook (Line 1)** — The scroll-stop. Must pass the "would I stop thumbing for this?" test. Employ one of:
   - Pattern interrupt (challenges an assumption the ICA holds)
   - Open loop (creates an information gap that demands resolution)
   - Bold claim (states a polarising or specific result)
   - Direct address (calls out the ICA by identity or situation)
   - Micro-story entry (drops the reader into a scene mid-action)

2. **Bridge (Lines 2–4)** — Expand the hook. Build tension, empathy, or context. Mirror the ICA's internal monologue using their exact vocabulary (pull from FutureProof context or user input).

3. **Body (Core content)** — Deliver the value tied to the post objective:
   - **Educational**: Use numbered steps, myth/truth, or "instead of X, try Y" structures
   - **Storytelling**: Follow situation → complication → resolution → lesson arc
   - **Social proof**: Lead with the specific result, then context, then the takeaway for the reader
   - **Promotional**: Stack benefits (not features), layer proof points, remove purchase friction
   - **Entertainment**: Commit to the bit — relatability over polish

4. **CTA (Final lines)** — One clear, low-friction action. Match CTA type to objective:
   - Engagement: binary question, "tag someone who…", or "save this for when…"
   - Traffic: specific benefit of clicking link in bio, not just "link in bio"
   - DMs: give the exact keyword and what they will receive
   - Sales: restate the transformation + urgency mechanism if authentic

5. **Hashtag & Formatting Layer**:
   - Hashtag strategy: 5–15 hashtags across three tiers (niche < 100K posts, mid-range 100K–1M, broad 1M+) relevant to the ICA's search behaviour, not vanity reach
   - Line breaks and emoji usage calibrated to brand voice (minimal and strategic unless brand voice is casual/expressive)
   - Accessibility: no emoji walls, meaningful alt-text recommendation for the visual

### 3C: Quality Assurance Audit

Score the draft against these six dimensions before presenting:

| Dimension | Criteria | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| **Hook strength** | Would this stop the ICA mid-scroll in a feed of competitors? | 20% |
| **ICA resonance** | Does the language mirror how the ICA speaks about this problem internally? | 20% |
| **Value density** | Is every sentence earning its place — zero filler? | 15% |
| **CTA clarity** | Is the next action singular, specific, and low-effort? | 15% |
| **Platform nativity** | Does this feel like Instagram-native content, not repurposed blog copy? | 15% |
| **Brand voice fidelity** | Would this be indistinguishable from the user's best-performing past posts? | 15% |

Apply any user-specific `instructions` from FutureProof context (e.g., "never use the word 'journey'", "always include a P.S. line", "our brand avoids ALL CAPS hooks").

## Step 4: Deliver Output

Produce a structured **Instagram Caption Deliverable**:

### Caption Strategy Brief
- ICA segment targeted
- Awareness stage
- Emotional hook type
- Post objective

### Primary Caption (Full text, ready to copy-paste)
- Hook → Bridge → Body → CTA → Hashtags, formatted exactly as it should appear on Instagram (with line breaks, spacing, and emoji placement)

### Alternate Hook Variants (×2)
- Two additional Line 1 options using different hook mechanisms, so the user can A/B test or choose based on intuition

### Caption Scorecard
- Score each of the six dimensions (1–10) with a one-line rationale per score

### Posting Recommendations
- Suggested posting time window (based on ICA behaviour patterns if available in FutureProof context)
- Recommended first-comment strategy (e.g., additional context, question prompt, or hashtag overflow)
- Engagement response plan: 2–3 templated reply prompts for likely comments, to boost algorithmic distribution in the first 30 minutes

## Step 5: Propose Experiments

```
FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="instagram-caption-writer", experiment={
  hypothesis: "Pattern-interrupt hooks outperform direct-address hooks for this ICA segment in educational content pillars",
  variants: ["control: direct-address hook — 'Hey [ICA identity], this is for you'", "variant: pattern-interrupt hook — 'Stop [common ICA behaviour]. Here's why.'"],
  measurement: "Save rate and share rate per impression across next 6 posts using each hook type",
  expected_impact: "20% increase in save rate, indicating higher perceived value and algorithmic boost"
})
```

## Step 6: Request Research

```
FutureProof:request_research(skill="instagram-caption-writer",
  query="Instagram algorithm ranking signals Q3-Q4 2024, caption length impact on reach by content type, and emerging engagement patterns for [user's niche/industry]",
  reason="Ensure caption architecture aligns with current algorithmic preferences and ICA consumption behaviour on the platform"
)
```

## Step 7: Save Session

```
FutureProof:save_session(skill="instagram-caption-writer", session={
  summary: "Wrote [content pillar] Instagram caption targeting [ICA segment] at [awareness stage] with [post objective] goal",
  key_findings: ["Hook type selected and rationale", "ICA vocabulary patterns applied", "Scorecard highlights and any dimensions below 7 flagged for future improvement"],
  user_feedback: null
})
```
