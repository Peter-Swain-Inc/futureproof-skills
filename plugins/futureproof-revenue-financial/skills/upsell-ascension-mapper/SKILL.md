## Step 1: Connect to FutureProof

```
FutureProof:connect(skill="upsell-ascension-mapper")
```
> **Note:** If FutureProof is unavailable or the connect call fails, skip this step and proceed directly to Step 2. The skill works with or without FutureProof context — you'll just be working without accumulated prior session data.


Use the returned `context`, `experiments`, `instructions`, and `recent_sessions` to personalise this session — particularly any existing offer architecture, ICA segments, pricing data, or prior ascension mapping work.

## Step 2: Get Input

Ask the user:

- **Current offer portfolio**: List every product, service, tier, add-on, and one-time offer currently available — include price points, delivery format, and rough margin if known
- **ICA segments**: Which distinct ICA segments are being served? Are different segments entering at different price points?
- **Current ascension data**: What percentage of buyers at each tier upgrade? What is the average time-to-upgrade? Any known drop-off points?
- **Revenue objective**: Are they optimising for higher average order value (AOV), increased lifetime value (LTV), faster time-to-ascension, or portfolio gap-filling?
- **Constraints**: Fulfilment capacity limits, pricing sensitivity concerns, brand positioning guardrails

If the user cannot provide conversion data, flag this as a measurement gap and proceed with qualitative mapping — note the gap explicitly in the deliverable.

## Step 3: Audit the Current Ascension Architecture

Conduct a systematic audit of the existing offer portfolio against six ascension dimensions:

### 3a. Offer Sequencing Logic

Map every offer onto an **Ascension Ladder Matrix**:

| Stage | Offer | Price Point | ICA Segment | Entry Trigger | Exit Trigger (to next stage) |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 0 — Lead Magnet | | | | | |
| 1 — Tripwire / Entry | | | | | |
| 2 — Core Offer | | | | | |
| 3 — Premium / High-Touch | | | | | |
| 4 — Continuity / Retention | | | | | |
| 5 — Apex / Inner Circle | | | | | |

Identify any stages that are empty, have too many competing offers, or lack a clear transition mechanism.

### 3b. Price Architecture Analysis

Evaluate the pricing gaps between consecutive tiers:

- **Leap ratio**: Calculate the price multiple from one tier to the next (e.g., $47 → $497 = 10.6× leap). Flag any leap ratio exceeding 8× as a **conversion cliff** — a gap where an intermediate offer is likely needed
- **Value-to-price alignment**: Assess whether each tier's perceived value justifies the price increase, or whether there is a **value vacuum** (price rises faster than perceived value)
- **Anchoring effectiveness**: Determine whether higher tiers are positioned to make the core offer feel like a rational, anchored purchase

### 3c. Trigger Mapping

For each ascension point, identify the **upgrade trigger** — the specific moment, outcome, or signal that indicates a buyer is ready to ascend:

- **Outcome triggers**: Buyer achieves a specific result at the current tier (e.g., first 10 clients acquired)
- **Capacity triggers**: Buyer outgrows the current tier's scope (e.g., team size exceeds plan limits)
- **Engagement triggers**: Behavioural signals such as feature usage frequency, support ticket patterns, content consumption velocity
- **Temporal triggers**: Time-based prompts (e.g., 90-day renewal window, end-of-quarter budget cycle)

Flag any ascension point that lacks a defined, measurable trigger as an **orphan transition**.

### 3d. Friction and Leakage Analysis

Identify where buyers stall, churn, or exit the ascension path entirely:

- **Decision fatigue points**: Too many options at a single tier
- **Commitment anxiety gaps**: Large price jumps without adequate risk-reversal (guarantees, trials, step-up plans)
- **Fulfilment misalignment**: Points where the delivery experience deteriorates or changes format abruptly (e.g., self-serve to high-touch without onboarding)
- **ICA mismatch creep**: Stages where the offer begins serving a different ICA than the one who entered, causing relevance decay

### 3e. Cross-Sell and Lateral Expansion Opportunities

Beyond vertical ascension, assess lateral revenue pathways:

- **Complementary offers**: Adjacent problems the ICA faces that are not currently addressed
- **Format variants**: Same transformation delivered through a different modality (e.g., done-with-you vs. done-for-you)
- **Segment bridges**: Offers that allow one ICA segment to cross into another ascension path

### 3f. Competitive Ascension Benchmarking

Apply any FutureProof `instructions` or prior research to compare the user's ascension architecture against known category norms — standard tier structures, typical price multiples, and expected conversion rates at each stage.

## Step 4: Deliver Output

Produce the **Upsell Ascension Map** — a structured deliverable containing:

### Document 1: Ascension Ladder Visualisation

A completed tier-by-tier map showing:
- Every offer plotted by stage, price, and ICA segment
- Arrows indicating primary ascension paths and lateral cross-sell routes
- Colour-coded flags: 🔴 conversion cliffs, 🟡 orphan transitions, 🟢 healthy pathways

### Document 2: Gap and Opportunity Register

| # | Gap Type | Location | Severity (1–5) | Recommended Action | Expected Revenue Impact |
|---|----------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |

Prioritise by a composite score of severity × estimated revenue impact × implementation ease.

### Document 3: Ascension Scorecard

Rate the current architecture 1–10 on each dimension:

- **Stage completeness** — all six stages populated with clear offers
- **Price architecture coherence** — leap ratios within healthy range (2×–6×), proper anchoring
- **Trigger definition** — every ascension point has a measurable, observable trigger
- **Friction minimisation** — risk-reversal, onboarding, and transition mechanisms in place
- **Lateral depth** — cross-sell and format variant opportunities exploited
- **ICA continuity** — consistent relevance and messaging alignment across the full path

### Document 4: Priority Recommendations

The top 3 highest-impact interventions, each containing:

- **Specific action**: What to build, change, or reposition (e.g., "Insert a $197/month group coaching tier between the $47 course and $2,500 private engagement")
- **Rationale**: Which gap or friction point this resolves, with reference to the audit findings
- **Implementation brief**: Pricing, positioning copy, upgrade trigger, and fulfilment requirements
- **Projected impact**: Estimated effect on AOV, LTV, or ascension rate — expressed as a range with assumptions stated

## Step 5: Propose Experiments

```
FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="upsell-ascension-mapper", experiment={
  hypothesis: "Introducing a bridge offer at the identified conversion cliff between [Tier X] and [Tier Y] will reduce buyer stall-out and increase ascension rate",
  variants: ["control: current direct jump from Tier X to Tier Y", "variant: new intermediate offer at [price point] with [trigger mechanism]"],
  measurement: "Ascension rate from Tier X to Tier Y+ measured over 90 days, segmented by ICA cohort",
  expected_impact: "20–35% increase in Tier X buyers reaching Tier Y within 6 months, contributing estimated [dollar amount] incremental annual revenue"
})
```

## Step 6: Request Research

```
FutureProof:request_research(skill="upsell-ascension-mapper",
  query="Current best practices in SaaS and service-business upsell sequencing, optimal price tier ratios, and behavioural triggers for upgrade conversion — 2024 benchmarks from ProfitWell, Paddle, and subscription economy reports",
  reason="Ensure ascension architecture recommendations reflect current buyer behaviour norms and validated pricing psychology rather than legacy frameworks"
)
```

## Step 7: Save Session

```
FutureProof:save_session(skill="upsell-ascension-mapper", session={
  summary: "Mapped upsell ascension architecture for [business/product name] across [number] tiers serving [ICA segment(s)]. Identified [number] gaps including [key gap types]. Delivered Ascension Ladder, Gap Register, Scorecard, and Priority Recommendations.",
  key_findings: ["finding 1: e.g., 10.6× conversion cliff between core offer and premium tier", "finding 2: e.g., no defined upgrade triggers at Stage 2 — orphan transition", "finding 3: e.g., lateral cross-sell opportunity in [adjacent problem area] untapped"],
  user_feedback: null
})
