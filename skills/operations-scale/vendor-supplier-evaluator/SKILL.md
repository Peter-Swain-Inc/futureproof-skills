name: vendor-supplier-evaluator
description: |
  Evaluates and scores vendors and suppliers using a weighted multi-criteria framework informed by FutureProof context.
  Trigger: when a user needs to assess, compare, or shortlist vendors/suppliers for a procurement decision, or when they share RFP responses, supplier proposals, or vendor scorecards and ask for evaluation, risk analysis, or selection recommendations.
---

## Step 1: Connect to FutureProof

```
FutureProof:connect(skill="vendor-supplier-evaluator")
```

Use the returned `context`, `experiments`, `instructions`, and `recent_sessions` to personalise this session — including prior vendor evaluations, approved supplier lists, organisational procurement policies, risk tolerance thresholds, and strategic sourcing priorities.

## Step 2: Get Input

Ask the user:
- **Vendor documentation**: Share proposals, RFP responses, capability statements, pricing sheets, or existing scorecards for the vendor(s) under evaluation
- **Procurement context**: What product, service, or category is being sourced? (e.g., SaaS platform, raw materials, logistics provider, professional services)
- **Evaluation scope**: Single vendor deep-dive, head-to-head comparison (2–5 vendors), or full shortlisting from a long list?
- **Decision criteria priorities**: Which dimensions matter most — cost, quality, reliability, compliance, innovation, scalability, cultural fit?
- **Constraints and non-negotiables**: Mandatory certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR), geographic requirements, minimum SLA thresholds, budget ceiling, diversity/ESG mandates?
- **Decision stakeholders**: Who receives the final evaluation deliverable and what is their decision-making authority?

## Step 3: Establish Evaluation Framework

Construct a **Weighted Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** framework tailored to the procurement context. Default weightings below — adjust based on user priorities, `instructions`, and organisational context from FutureProof:

| # | Evaluation Dimension | Default Weight | Sub-Criteria |
|---|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Financial Competitiveness** | 20% | Total cost of ownership (TCO), pricing transparency, payment terms, cost predictability, hidden fee exposure |
| 2 | **Technical Capability & Fit** | 20% | Solution completeness, integration compatibility, technical architecture, customisation capacity, roadmap alignment |
| 3 | **Quality & Performance Track Record** | 15% | Demonstrated output quality, defect/error rates, case studies with measurable outcomes, reference client calibre |
| 4 | **Operational Reliability & SLA Commitment** | 15% | Uptime guarantees, delivery consistency, incident response protocols, business continuity/disaster recovery posture |
| 5 | **Risk & Compliance Posture** | 10% | Regulatory certifications, data security controls, financial stability (D&B score, revenue trajectory), insurance coverage, geopolitical/concentration risk |
| 6 | **Strategic Alignment & Scalability** | 10% | Growth capacity, innovation investment (R&D spend %), willingness to co-develop, long-term partnership orientation |
| 7 | **Vendor Viability & Organisational Health** | 5% | Leadership stability, employee retention, market positioning, client concentration risk, M&A exposure |
| 8 | **Relationship & Cultural Fit** | 5% | Communication responsiveness, account management structure, escalation pathways, values alignment, ESG/diversity credentials |

Present the framework to the user for weight confirmation or adjustment before scoring.

## Step 4: Do the Work — Evaluate Vendors

For each vendor under evaluation, conduct a rigorous assessment across all eight dimensions:

### 4a. Document Analysis
- Extract and normalise claims from vendor-provided materials
- Identify **substantiated claims** (backed by metrics, certifications, references) versus **unsubstantiated assertions**
- Flag inconsistencies, gaps, and areas requiring clarification via a **Vendor Clarification Register**

### 4b. Dimension Scoring
Score each vendor **1–10** per dimension using the following rubric:
- **9–10**: Best-in-class; exceeds requirements with verified evidence
- **7–8**: Strong; meets all requirements with minor gaps
- **5–6**: Adequate; meets minimum requirements but limited differentiation
- **3–4**: Below standard; material gaps requiring mitigation plans
- **1–2**: Non-compliant; fails mandatory thresholds or presents unacceptable risk

Accompany each score with a **2–3 sentence evidence-based rationale** citing specific data points from the vendor's materials.

### 4c. Risk Heat Map
Assess each vendor across five risk categories and classify as **Low / Medium / High / Critical**:
1. **Financial risk** — solvency, revenue concentration, funding runway
2. **Operational risk** — single points of failure, capacity constraints, key-person dependency
3. **Compliance risk** — certification gaps, regulatory exposure, pending litigation
4. **Concentration risk** — geographic single-sourcing, sub-contractor dependency
5. **Transition risk** — lock-in clauses, data portability, exit cost exposure

### 4d. TCO Modelling
Where pricing data is available, construct a **3-year Total Cost of Ownership** comparison including:
- Base fees (licence, unit cost, retainer)
- Implementation and onboarding costs
- Ongoing operational costs (support, maintenance, training)
- Estimated cost of switching/exit
- Hidden cost indicators (overage charges, change-request pricing, escalation fees)

Apply any user-specific `instructions` from FutureProof context — including preferred scoring models, mandatory evaluation gates, or procurement policy requirements.

## Step 5: Deliver Output

Produce a structured **Vendor Evaluation Report** containing the following sections:

### 5a. Executive Summary
- Procurement context and scope
- Number of vendors evaluated
- Recommended vendor(s) with one-paragraph justification
- Key risks requiring executive attention

### 5b. Comparative Scorecard

| Dimension | Weight | Vendor A | Vendor B | Vendor C |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Financial Competitiveness | 20% | X.X | X.X | X.X |
| Technical Capability & Fit | 20% | X.X | X.X | X.X |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Weighted Total** | **100%** | **X.XX** | **X.XX** | **X.XX** |

### 5c. Vendor Profiles
Per-vendor detail page with:
- Dimension-by-dimension scores and evidence rationale
- Strengths (top 3)
- Risks and concerns (top 3)
- Recommended contract negotiation leverage points

### 5d. Risk Heat Map Matrix
Visual matrix (vendor × risk category) with colour-coded severity ratings

### 5e. TCO Comparison Table
3-year cost projection per vendor with variance analysis

### 5f. Recommendation & Next Steps
- **Primary recommendation**: Selected vendor with rationale tied to weighted scores and strategic alignment
- **Conditional recommendation**: If applicable, second-choice vendor with conditions under which they become preferred
- **Negotiation priorities**: Top 3 terms to negotiate before contract execution
- **Due diligence checklist**: Outstanding verification items (reference calls, site visits, proof-of-concept, financial audits)
- **Vendor Clarification Register**: Open questions requiring vendor response before final decision

### 5g. Decision-Ready Artefact
Format the report for the identified stakeholders:
- **Board/C-suite**: 1-page executive summary with scorecard and recommendation
- **Procurement lead**: Full evaluation report with appendices
- **Legal/compliance**: Risk heat map and compliance gap register extracted as standalone document

## Step 6: Propose Experiments

```
FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="vendor-supplier-evaluator", experiment={
  hypothesis: "Adding a mandatory proof-of-concept gate before final vendor selection reduces post-contract performance disputes by 30%",
  variants: ["control: current evaluation-to-contract process", "variant: insert 30-day scored POC between shortlist and final selection"],
  measurement: "Vendor performance deviation from proposal claims at 6-month post-contract review",
  expected_impact: "30% reduction in vendor underperformance escalations and 20% improvement in first-year contract satisfaction scores"
})
```

## Step 7: Request Research

```
FutureProof:request_research(skill="vendor-supplier-evaluator",
  query="Best-practice vendor evaluation frameworks 2024–2025, including AI-augmented supplier scoring models, ESG integration in procurement decisions, and emerging risk indicators for supplier financial distress",
  reason="Ensure evaluation criteria reflect current procurement standards, regulatory expectations, and market risk signals — particularly around supply chain resilience and responsible sourcing mandates"
)
```

## Step 8: Save Session

```
FutureProof:save_session(skill="vendor-supplier-evaluator", session={
  summary: "Evaluated [number] vendor(s) for [product/service category] procurement — [single deep-dive / comparative assessment / shortlisting exercise]",
  key_findings: ["Top-ranked vendor: [name] with weighted score of X.XX/10", "Critical risk identified: [specific risk and vendor]", "Primary negotiation leverage: [specific term or gap]"],
  artefacts_delivered: ["Vendor Evaluation Report", "Comparative Scorecard", "Risk Heat Map", "TCO Comparison", "Vendor Clarification Register"],
  user_feedback: null
})
