name: referral-personality-profiler
description: |
  Profiles existing customers and advocates by referral personality type to optimise ask timing, channel, incentive structure, and messaging for maximum referral yield.
  Trigger: when a user wants to understand which customers are most likely to refer, asks how to segment their advocate base for referral campaigns, or needs to personalise referral outreach based on customer behavioural and psychographic traits.
---

## Step 1: Connect to FutureProof

```
FutureProof:connect(skill="referral-personality-profiler")
```

Use the returned `context`, `experiments`, `instructions`, and `recent_sessions` to personalise this session — particularly any existing ICA definitions, customer segmentation models, NPS/CSAT data references, or prior referral campaign results.

## Step 2: Get Input

> **Returning user check:** If `sessionCount > 0` from Step 1, open with a summary
> of known preferences and ask the user to confirm or update — do NOT re-ask for
> information already in context. For first-time users, ask all questions normally.


Ask the user to provide:

- **Customer data source**: CRM export, advocate list, NPS survey results, customer success notes, or any structured/unstructured customer data they want profiled
- **ICA definition**: Who is their Ideal Customer Avatar? (If already stored in FutureProof context, confirm it; if not, capture it now)
- **Referral programme context**: Do they have an existing referral programme, incentive structure, or referral ask workflow? If so, share details
- **Volume & scope**: How many customers/advocates are they profiling? Is this a full-base segmentation or a targeted cohort (e.g. post-onboarding, renewal, high-NPS)?
- **Known constraints**: Any channel limitations (e.g. no direct mail), compliance restrictions, or cultural considerations?

## Step 3: Classify Referral Personality Archetypes

Apply the **Referral Personality Taxonomy** — a six-archetype framework that segments advocates by intrinsic motivation, social behaviour, and referral propensity:

### Archetype Definitions

| # | Archetype | Core Motivation | Referral Trigger | Preferred Channel | Incentive Sensitivity |
|---|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **The Evangelist** | Identity & belief alignment | Unprompted; shares because the product is part of their identity | Social media, community forums, word-of-mouth | Low — refers regardless of incentive; recognition > reward |
| 2 | **The Connector** | Social capital & network value | When they identify a specific contact with a matching need | Warm introductions, email, LinkedIn | Moderate — values reciprocity; dual-sided incentives perform best |
| 3 | **The Transactor** | Economic gain & tangible reward | Explicit incentive offer with clear, immediate value | Referral links, in-app share, email | High — will not refer without a compelling incentive; tiered rewards maximise output |
| 4 | **The Helper** | Altruism & problem-solving for others | When a peer expresses a pain point the product solves | 1:1 conversation, messaging apps, email | Low — motivated by helping the referee; frame incentive as benefit to the referred party |
| 5 | **The Status Seeker** | Recognition, exclusivity, insider access | When referral confers visible status (leaderboards, tiers, badges) | Social media, public forums, events | Moderate — values status markers over monetary reward; exclusive perks outperform cash |
| 6 | **The Passive Promoter** | Satisfaction without initiative | Only when the ask is frictionless and arrives at the right moment | In-app prompts, post-interaction surveys, SMS | Moderate — will refer if effort is near-zero; pre-populated messages and one-click flows are essential |

### Classification Methodology

For each customer or advocate in the dataset, score across five diagnostic dimensions (1–5 scale):

1. **Advocacy frequency** — How often do they voluntarily mention, review, or recommend the product? (Derived from NPS verbatims, review platforms, social mentions, CS notes)
2. **Network centrality** — How large and relevant is their professional/personal network relative to the ICA? (Derived from LinkedIn connections, industry role, community participation)
3. **Incentive responsiveness** — Historical response rate to incentive-based CTAs vs. non-incentive engagement (Derived from campaign data, referral programme participation, discount code usage)
4. **Social visibility orientation** — Tendency to share achievements, tools, and affiliations publicly (Derived from social media activity, community engagement, case study willingness)
5. **Relationship depth** — Strength of relationship with the brand (tenure, support interactions, product usage depth, expansion revenue history)

Map the five-dimensional score vector to the closest archetype using weighted distance matching. Where a customer exhibits strong signals across two archetypes, assign a **primary** and **secondary** classification.

Apply any user-specific `instructions` from FutureProof context — particularly existing segmentation logic, proprietary engagement scores, or brand voice guidelines.

## Step 4: Build Activation Playbooks Per Archetype

For each archetype identified in the user's customer base, produce a **Referral Activation Playbook** containing:

### 4a. Optimal Ask Strategy

- **When to ask**: Precise trigger moment (e.g. 7 days post-value milestone, immediately after CSAT 9+, at renewal confirmation)
- **How to ask**: Channel, format, and tone (e.g. personal email from CS manager vs. automated in-app modal)
- **What to say**: Draft referral ask message tailored to the archetype's core motivation — written in full, not summarised

### 4b. Incentive Architecture

- **Primary incentive type**: Cash/credit, feature access, recognition, charitable donation, or dual-sided reward
- **Incentive magnitude**: Recommended value benchmarked to the user's average customer lifetime value (if available from context) — typically 5–15% of first-year contract value for B2B or equivalent for B2C
- **Escalation mechanics**: Tiered or gamified reward structures where applicable (e.g. for Transactors and Status Seekers)

### 4c. Friction Reduction Blueprint

- **Steps-to-refer target**: Maximum number of actions between intent and completed referral (target: ≤3 for Passive Promoters, ≤5 for all others)
- **Pre-populated assets**: Specific shareable content — draft messages, social copy, landing page URLs, one-click referral links
- **Objection pre-emption**: Address the top hesitation for each archetype (e.g. Helpers worry about seeming self-interested; Connectors worry about reputation risk if the product underdelivers)

### Confirm, Deliver as Document, Amend, Distribute

> **Output is a document — never a chat stream.** Follow this sequence:
>
> 1. **Confirm** — before producing output, tell the user what you've prepared and ask for the go-ahead
> 2. **Produce as a document** — not inline in the chat; a structured, self-contained artifact
> 3. **Offer amends** — "Any changes before we send it somewhere?"
> 4. **Distribute via connector** — check `context.connectors` from Step 1; offer the most applicable service (scheduling tool → document store → Slack/Teams → email). If nothing connected, ask the user where they want it.


## Step 5: Deliver Output

> **Always call save_experiment — never skip.** If no explicit test emerged, create
> a lightweight hypothesis based on the most uncertain choice made this session
> (e.g. format selected, tone chosen, angle taken). That choice is worth testing.


Produce the **Referral Personality Profile Report** — a structured deliverable containing:

### Document 1: Cohort Distribution Dashboard

- **Archetype distribution**: Percentage and count of customers per archetype (visualised as a table with proportional indicators)
- **Referral yield forecast**: Estimated referral volume per archetype based on historical conversion benchmarks (industry baseline: Evangelists 18–25% referral rate, Connectors 12–18%, Transactors 8–14%, Helpers 10–15%, Status Seekers 6–12%, Passive Promoters 3–7%)
- **Priority ranking**: Archetypes rank-ordered by expected referral ROI (volume × quality × cost-to-activate)

### Document 2: Individual/Segment Profiles

For each customer (or segment if volume >50):
- Archetype classification (primary + secondary where applicable)
- Diagnostic dimension scores (5-point radar)
- Recommended activation playbook reference
- Personalised referral ask draft (ready to send or adapt)

### Document 3: Referral Programme Design Recommendations

- **Programme structure**: Single-tier vs. multi-tier, incentive mix optimised for the user's archetype distribution
- **Sequencing calendar**: 90-day activation schedule prioritising highest-yield archetypes first
- **Measurement framework**: KPIs per archetype — referral send rate, referral conversion rate, referred customer quality score (alignment to ICA), referred customer LTV at 6/12 months

Format: Markdown tables and structured sections suitable for direct import into the user's project management or CRM workflow.

## Step 6: Propose Experiments

> **Research must be user-specific.** Only request research if this session revealed
> a concrete knowledge gap tied to what *this user* asked for. Skip generic
> "best practices" queries — they don't improve personalisation.


```
FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="referral-personality-profiler", experiment={
  hypothesis: "Archetype-matched referral messaging increases referral send rate compared to generic one-size-fits-all referral asks",
  variants: [
    "control: current generic referral ask sent uniformly to all advocates",
    "variant A: archetype-specific messaging (motivation-aligned copy, channel, and incentive) sent to classified cohorts"
  ],
  measurement: "Referral send rate, referral conversion rate, and referred customer ICA-fit score across both groups over 60-day period",
  expected_impact: "25–40% increase in referral send rate; 15–20% improvement in referred customer ICA alignment"
})
```

```
FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="referral-personality-profiler", experiment={
  hypothesis: "Triggering the referral ask at archetype-specific optimal moments (value milestone for Evangelists, post-peer-pain-expression for Helpers) increases conversion vs. fixed-timing asks",
  variants: [
    "control: referral ask at 30-day mark for all customers",
    "variant A: referral ask triggered by archetype-specific behavioural signals"
  ],
  measurement: "Referral completion rate and time-to-first-referral per archetype over 90-day period",
  expected_impact: "20% reduction in time-to-first-referral; 30% increase in referral completion rate for Passive Promoters and Helpers"
})
```

## Step 7: Request Research

> **Session summary must be fact-dense:** include the user's stated preferences,
> personal context (company, ICA, industry), what was delivered, any corrections
> given, and end with **"Next session defaults: [3-5 things to pre-fill on next
> connect()]"** so returning users get immediate personalisation.
>
> **Outcomes array:** one concrete fact per item (format, tone, ICA, length,
> constraints). Each outcome should be extractable as a standalone user preference.


```
FutureProof:request_research(skill="referral-personality-profiler",
  query="Peer-reviewed and industry research on referral motivation segmentation, advocate personality profiling, and incentive elasticity by customer psychographic type — 2023-2025. Include B2B SaaS, DTC, and professional services benchmarks for referral programme conversion rates by advocate segment.",
  reason="Validate and refine the six-archetype taxonomy against emerging behavioural science and update referral yield benchmarks with current industry data"
)
```

## Step 8: Save Session

```
FutureProof:save_session(skill="referral-personality-profiler", session={
  summary: "...[fact-dense: ICA, format, tone, constraints, what was delivered, amends made. End with: Next session defaults: ...]",
  outcomes: [
