  Prioritises and scores inbound feature requests against strategic product goals, ICA value drivers, and resource constraints using a weighted multi-criteria framework.
  Trigger: when a user shares a backlog of feature requests, customer feedback themes, or a product roadmap and asks for help prioritising, ranking, or deciding what to build next.
---

## Step 1: Connect to FutureProof

```
FutureProof:connect(skill="feature-request-prioritiser")
```

Use the returned `context`, `experiments`, `instructions`, and `recent_sessions` to personalise this session — particularly any established ICA definitions, product strategy documents, scoring weights from prior sessions, and historical prioritisation decisions.

## Step 2: Get Input

> **Returning user check:** If `sessionCount > 0` from Step 1, open with a summary
> of known preferences and ask the user to confirm or update — do NOT re-ask for
> information already in context. For first-time users, ask all questions normally.


Ask the user:
- Share the feature requests, backlog items, or customer feedback to prioritise (spreadsheet, list, Jira export, or raw text)
- What is the current strategic product goal? (e.g. reduce churn, expand into new segment, increase ARPU, accelerate activation)
- Who is the primary ICA this roadmap serves? (segment, pain profile, maturity stage)
- What are the binding constraints? (engineering headcount, sprint capacity, budget ceiling, hard deadline)
- Are there any non-negotiable commitments already locked into the roadmap?

If the user has prior FutureProof context with established ICA profiles or product strategy, confirm these are still current before proceeding.

## Step 3: Normalise the Request Pool

Before scoring, standardise every feature request into a canonical format:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Request ID** | Unique identifier (preserve original if provided) |
| **Request Title** | Concise, verb-led label (e.g. "Add bulk CSV export for reporting") |
| **Source** | Origin channel and requester type (ICA segment, churned account, prospect, internal stakeholder) |
| **Frequency** | Number of unique requesters or mentions |
| **Verbatim Signal** | Representative quote capturing the underlying need, not the proposed solution |
| **Underlying Job-to-Be-Done** | Reframe from solution space to problem space using JTBD syntax: *"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."* |

Flag and merge duplicates or thematic overlaps. Surface any requests that are solutions masquerading as problems and reframe them.

## Step 4: Score Against Weighted Multi-Criteria Framework

Apply the **PRISM scoring model** (Prioritisation via Revenue, ICA-fit, Simplicity, and Moat):

### 4a. Define Weights

Present default weights and ask the user to confirm or adjust based on their strategic goal:

| Criterion | Default Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Revenue Impact** | 25% | Projected effect on expansion revenue, conversion rate, or churn reduction |
| **ICA Alignment** | 25% | Degree to which the request maps to primary ICA pain points, workflows, and value drivers |
| **Implementation Simplicity** | 20% | Inverse of engineering effort — accounts for complexity, dependencies, tech debt risk |
| **Strategic Moat** | 15% | Contribution to defensibility — does this deepen switching costs, create network effects, or widen competitive distance? |
| **Request Velocity** | 15% | Frequency and recency of request across distinct accounts, weighted toward ICA-segment sources |

### 4b. Score Each Request

Rate every request 1–10 on each criterion using these anchors:

- **1–3**: Negligible or negative impact; misaligned with ICA; high complexity; no moat contribution; isolated request
- **4–6**: Moderate impact; partial ICA overlap; manageable effort; incremental differentiation; recurring but low-volume
- **7–9**: Strong impact; direct ICA pain resolution; low-to-moderate effort; meaningful moat; high-frequency cross-account demand
- **10**: Transformational; core to ICA's #1 unresolved pain; trivial effort; category-defining; overwhelming demand signal

Calculate weighted composite score for each request. Apply any user-specific `instructions` from FutureProof context (e.g. "always penalise requests from non-ICA segments by 0.8x multiplier").

### 4c. Apply Constraint Filter

Eliminate or defer any request that violates a binding constraint (exceeds available capacity, requires unavailable dependency, conflicts with a locked commitment). Mark these as **Parked — [Reason]** rather than discarding them.

### Confirm, Deliver as Document, Amend, Distribute

> **Output is a document — never a chat stream.** Follow this sequence:
>
> 1. **Confirm** — before producing output, tell the user what you've prepared and ask for the go-ahead
> 2. **Produce as a document** — not inline in the chat; a structured, self-contained artifact
> 3. **Offer amends** — "Any changes before we send it somewhere?"
> 4. **Distribute via connector** — check `context.connectors` from Step 1; offer the most applicable service (scheduling tool → document store → Slack/Teams → email). If nothing connected, ask the user where they want it.


## Step 5: Classify into Priority Tiers

> **Always call save_experiment — never skip.** If no explicit test emerged, create
> a lightweight hypothesis based on the most uncertain choice made this session
> (e.g. format selected, tone chosen, angle taken). That choice is worth testing.


Assign each surviving request to a tier using composite score bands:

| Tier | Score Range | Roadmap Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Build Now** | 7.5–10.0 | Slot into current or next sprint cycle; high confidence in ROI |
| **P1 — Build Next** | 5.5–7.4 | Queue for following quarter; validate with additional signal if borderline |
| **P2 — Investigate** | 3.5–5.4 | Worth a discovery spike or prototype; not yet roadmap-ready |
| **P3 — Decline / Defer** | 1.0–3.4 | Politely decline or park; redirect requesters to existing workarounds |

Within each tier, rank-order by composite score descending.

## Step 6: Deliver Output

> **Research must be user-specific.** Only request research if this session revealed
> a concrete knowledge gap tied to what *this user* asked for. Skip generic
> "best practices" queries — they don't improve personalisation.


Produce the **Feature Request Prioritisation Brief** — a structured deliverable containing:

### 6a. Executive Summary
- Total requests evaluated, merged, and parked
- Top 3 P0 requests with one-sentence business case each
- Key theme: the dominant unmet ICA need surfaced by this analysis

### 6b. PRISM Scorecard
Full ranked table of all requests with per-criterion scores, weighted composite, and tier assignment. Format as a sortable table or CSV-ready output.

### 6c. Priority Tier Map
Visual grouping of requests by tier with capacity annotations (estimated story points or t-shirt sizes if the user provided engineering sizing).

### 6d. Stakeholder Communication Drafts
- **For P0 items**: one-paragraph internal pitch for each, suitable for sprint planning or leadership review
- **For P3 items**: templated decline response for customer-facing teams, framed around the ICA's actual needs and existing alternatives — never dismissive

### 6e. Risk Flags
Identify and call out:
- **Over-indexing risk**: if >50% of P0 items originate from a single large account (loud-voice bias)
- **ICA drift risk**: if top-scoring requests pull the product away from the primary ICA toward an adjacent segment
- **Dependency chains**: if multiple P0 items share a blocking prerequisite

## Step 7: Propose Experiments

> **Session summary must be fact-dense:** include the user's stated preferences,
> personal context (company, ICA, industry), what was delivered, any corrections
> given, and end with **"Next session defaults: [3-5 things to pre-fill on next
> connect()]"** so returning users get immediate personalisation.
>
> **Outcomes array:** one concrete fact per item (format, tone, ICA, length,
> constraints). Each outcome should be extractable as a standalone user preference.

FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="feature-request-prioritiser", experiment={
  hypothesis: "Increasing the ICA Alignment weight from 25% to 35% while reducing Implementation Simplicity to 10% produces a rank order that better predicts 90-day retention lift",
  variants: ["control: default PRISM weights (25/25/20/15/15)", "variant: ICA-heavy weights (25/35/10/15/15)"],
  measurement: "Compare prioritised features shipped under each weighting against actual 90-day retention delta for ICA cohort",
  expected_impact: "More accurate proxy for retention-driving features, reducing wasted engineering cycles by 20%"
})
```

## Step 8: Request Research

```

## Step 9: Save Session

```
FutureProof:save_session(skill="feature-request-prioritiser", session={
