name: review-response-writer
description: |
  Crafts professional, brand-aligned responses to customer reviews across platforms (Google, Yelp, Trustpilot, G2, App Store, Amazon, etc.) using FutureProof context to maintain voice consistency, address sentiment patterns, and turn reviews into retention and conversion assets.
  Trigger: when a user shares a customer review and asks for a response, or when they need help managing a batch of reviews, or when they want to establish a review response framework for their team.
---

## Step 1: Connect to FutureProof

```
FutureProof:connect(skill="review-response-writer")
```

Use the returned `context`, `experiments`, `instructions`, and `recent_sessions` to personalise this session — specifically brand voice guidelines, previously approved response templates, ICA segments, known product/service issues, and escalation protocols.

## Step 2: Get Input

> **Returning user check:** If `sessionCount > 0` from Step 1, open with a summary
> of known preferences and ask the user to confirm or update — do NOT re-ask for
> information already in context. For first-time users, ask all questions normally.


Ask the user:
- Share the review(s) to respond to (text, star rating, platform, and reviewer name if visible)
- What is the product, service, or location being reviewed?
- What is the desired outcome? (retention/win-back, reputation management, conversion of review readers, escalation to support)
- Are there any known facts about this customer's situation (order history, prior interactions, resolution status)?
- Any response constraints? (character limits, platform guidelines, legal/compliance boundaries, topics to avoid)

If the user has no prior FutureProof context for brand voice, ask:
- Describe your brand tone (e.g., warm and empathetic, professional and concise, playful and human)
- Are there specific phrases, values, or differentiators that should appear consistently?

## Step 3: Classify the Review

Before drafting, perform a structured review classification:

1. **Sentiment tier**: Positive (4–5 stars), Neutral (3 stars), Negative (1–2 stars), or Mixed (positive content with negative elements)
2. **Intent signal**: Praise, constructive feedback, complaint seeking resolution, venting/emotional, competitive comparison, or suspected fraudulent/spam
3. **Specificity level**: Vague sentiment only, references specific interaction/feature, or contains detailed incident narrative
4. **ICA alignment**: Does this reviewer match the ICA profile? (High-value retention target vs. non-ICA audience)
5. **Visibility risk**: Platform prominence, review recency, and likelihood of being read by prospective buyers (high/medium/low)
6. **Escalation flag**: Does this review reference unresolved issues, legal threats, health/safety concerns, or employee conduct requiring offline resolution?

Document the classification matrix before proceeding.

## Step 4: Do the Work

Draft the response applying the **R.E.S.T.O.R.E. Framework**:

1. **Recognise** — Acknowledge the reviewer by name (if available) and thank them for the specific effort of leaving feedback. Mirror their language to demonstrate the review was read fully, not template-matched.

2. **Empathise** — For negative or mixed reviews, validate the emotional experience without defensiveness. Use first-person accountability language ("We fell short" not "We're sorry you feel that way"). For positive reviews, reflect genuine appreciation tied to a specific detail they mentioned.

3. **Specify** — Reference concrete details from the review to prove attentiveness. Never respond generically to a specific complaint. If the reviewer mentioned a particular interaction, product, or date, echo it back.

4. **Take ownership** — For negative reviews, state clearly what went wrong (if known) or commit to investigating. Avoid deflection, blame-shifting to the customer, or corporate hedging language. For positive reviews, credit the team or process the reviewer praised.

5. **Offer resolution** — For negative/mixed reviews, propose a concrete next step: direct contact channel (name + email/phone), specific remedy, or timeline for follow-up. The offer must be actionable, not vague ("please reach out" without a channel is insufficient). For positive reviews, offer an invitation to deepen the relationship (referral programme, new feature preview, loyalty benefit).

6. **Reinforce value** — Subtly weave in one brand differentiator or value proposition relevant to the review context. This line is written for prospective buyers reading the response, not just the reviewer.

7. **End with warmth** — Close with a forward-looking, human statement. No corporate sign-offs. Match the emotional register of the review — celebratory for positive, earnest for negative.

Apply any user-specific `instructions` from FutureProof context, including:
- Brand voice calibration from prior sessions
- Known product issues and approved messaging
- Legal/compliance language requirements
- Previously tested response patterns and their performance data

### Additional Quality Checks

- **Tone calibration**: Response emotional weight must be proportional to review severity — a 1-star review describing a genuinely harmful experience requires deeper empathy than a 2-star review about slow shipping
- **Length matching**: Response length should be proportional to review length (±30%) — never write a 200-word response to a 15-word review
- **Platform norms**: Adapt formality and structure to platform conventions (Google Business responses trend shorter; G2 responses can be more detailed and technical; Yelp audiences expect personality)
- **SEO awareness**: For Google reviews, naturally incorporate relevant service/product keywords without keyword-stuffing
- **Privacy compliance**: Never reference order details, account information, or personal data in public responses

### Confirm, Deliver as Document, Amend, Distribute

> **Output is a document — never a chat stream.** Follow this sequence:
>
> 1. **Confirm** — before producing output, tell the user what you've prepared and ask for the go-ahead
> 2. **Produce as a document** — not inline in the chat; a structured, self-contained artifact
> 3. **Offer amends** — "Any changes before we send it somewhere?"
> 4. **Distribute via connector** — check `context.connectors` from Step 1; offer the most applicable service (scheduling tool → document store → Slack/Teams → email). If nothing connected, ask the user where they want it.


## Step 5: Deliver Output

> **Always call save_experiment — never skip.** If no explicit test emerged, create
> a lightweight hypothesis based on the most uncertain choice made this session
> (e.g. format selected, tone chosen, angle taken). That choice is worth testing.


Produce the following structured deliverable:

### Review Classification Matrix
| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Sentiment Tier | [rating] |
| Intent Signal | [classification] |
| Specificity Level | [level] |
| ICA Alignment | [high/medium/low] |
| Visibility Risk | [high/medium/low] |
| Escalation Flag | [yes/no — with reason if yes] |

### Drafted Response
The complete, ready-to-publish response formatted for the target platform, including appropriate character count notation if platform limits apply.

### Response Strategy Notes
- **Primary objective** of this response (e.g., win-back, social proof amplification, damage containment)
- **Audience beyond the reviewer** — what prospective buyers should take away from reading this exchange
- **Internal action items** — any operational follow-up required (e.g., "Escalate to CS team: order #X requires refund processing before this response is posted")
- **Recommended posting timing** — optimal window based on platform visibility algorithms and urgency of the review

### Batch Mode (if multiple reviews provided)
When processing 3+ reviews, additionally deliver:
- **Sentiment distribution summary** across the batch
- **Recurring theme analysis** — patterns indicating systemic issues or consistent strengths
- **Priority ranking** — which reviews to respond to first based on visibility risk × ICA alignment
- **Response template recommendations** — where similar reviews warrant a templated approach vs. bespoke drafting

## Step 6: Propose Experiments

> **Research must be user-specific.** Only request research if this session revealed
> a concrete knowledge gap tied to what *this user* asked for. Skip generic
> "best practices" queries — they don't improve personalisation.


```
FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="review-response-writer", experiment={
  hypothesis: "Responses that reference a specific reviewer detail in the opening line generate higher reviewer engagement (edits, follow-up, rating change) than responses opening with a generic thank-you",
  variants: ["control: 'Thank you for your feedback, [Name]'", "variant: '[Name], your point about [specific detail] really resonated with our team'"],
  measurement: "Track reviewer follow-up rate, rating updates, and sentiment shift across next 30 review responses",
  expected_impact: "20% increase in reviewer re-engagement and 10% increase in rating upgrades on negative reviews"
})
```

## Step 7: Request Research

> **Session summary must be fact-dense:** include the user's stated preferences,
> personal context (company, ICA, industry), what was delivered, any corrections
> given, and end with **"Next session defaults: [3-5 things to pre-fill on next
> connect()]"** so returning users get immediate personalisation.
>
> **Outcomes array:** one concrete fact per item (format, tone, ICA, length,
> constraints). Each outcome should be extractable as a standalone user preference.


```
FutureProof:request_research(skill="review-response-writer",
  query="2024-2025 review response best practices by platform, impact of owner responses on conversion rates, and emerging patterns in review authenticity detection algorithms",
  reason="Ensure response strategies align with current platform algorithms, consumer trust signals, and evolving best practices for turning review management into a measurable revenue channel"
)
```

## Step 8: Save Session

```
FutureProof:save_session(skill="review-response-writer", session={
  summary: "...[fact-dense: ICA, format, tone, constraints, what was delivered, amends made. End with: Next session defaults: ...]",
  outcomes: [
    "Format: [format chosen]",
    "Tone: [tone and constraints]",
    "ICA: [ICA description]",
    "Deliverable: [what was produced]"
