name: invisible-demand-detector
description: |
  Detects latent, unarticulated, and emerging demand signals that competitors overlook — surfacing invisible market needs before they become visible trends.
  Trigger: when a user wants to discover unmet needs, hidden demand, or whitespace opportunities in their market, or when they say something like "I feel like there's demand we're not seeing" or "what are people in our market struggling with that nobody is solving?"

## Step 1: Connect to FutureProof

```
FutureProof:connect(skill="invisible-demand-detector")
```

Use the returned `context`, `experiments`, `instructions`, and `recent_sessions` to personalise this session — particularly any existing ICA profiles, market positioning, prior demand hypotheses, and validated/invalidated experiments from previous runs.

## Step 2: Get Input

> **Returning user check:** If `sessionCount > 0` from Step 1, open with a summary
> of known preferences and ask the user to confirm or update — do NOT re-ask for
> information already in context. For first-time users, ask all questions normally.


Ask the user:

- **Market scope**: What industry, niche, or vertical are we investigating? (e.g., "B2B fintech for mid-market CFOs," "DTC wellness for millennial women")
- **ICA definition**: Who is the ideal customer? Share any existing ICA profiles, or describe the person/organisation whose invisible pain we're hunting for
- **Current offer landscape**: What do you currently sell, and what do your top 3–5 competitors offer? (links, descriptions, or summaries accepted)
- **Signal sources available**: Do you have access to any of the following — support tickets, community forums, sales call recordings, social listening data, review/NPS data, search console queries, refund/cancellation reasons?
- **Constraint boundaries**: Any markets, segments, or problem spaces explicitly out of scope?

If the user has prior sessions in FutureProof context, pre-populate known answers and ask only for confirmation or updates.

## Step 3: Map the Signal Landscape

Conduct a **five-layer signal audit** to identify where invisible demand hides. For each layer, categorise signals as _strong_, _moderate_, or _weak_ based on frequency, emotional intensity, and absence of existing solutions.

### Layer 1: Complaint Mining (Expressed Frustration)
- Analyse language patterns in reviews, support tickets, and community posts for the ICA's market
- Identify **high-emotion, low-resolution complaints** — problems people raise repeatedly but accept as unsolvable
- Flag vocabulary clusters: words and phrases the ICA uses that no vendor currently mirrors in positioning

### Layer 2: Workaround Detection (Behavioural Signals)
- Identify DIY solutions, spreadsheet hacks, duct-tape integrations, and manual processes the ICA uses to compensate for missing products/features
- Map **tool-stacking patterns** — where the ICA combines 3+ tools to solve one job-to-be-done, indicating a consolidation opportunity
- Surface "I just wish..." and "does anyone know how to..." patterns from forums, Reddit, Slack communities, and Q&A sites

### Layer 3: Adjacent Demand Bleed (Cross-Market Signals)
- Identify demand that is **clearly expressed in adjacent markets** but has not yet been addressed in the user's target market
- Apply analogical transfer: what solutions are thriving in parallel verticals that could be adapted?
- Detect **category creation signals** — terminology the ICA is inventing because no existing category label fits their need

### Layer 4: Negative Space Analysis (What's Conspicuously Absent)
- Audit competitor positioning for **uniform blind spots** — problems every competitor ignores or explicitly deprioritises
- Identify ICA jobs-to-be-done that appear in no competitor's messaging, feature set, or content strategy
- Map the **"nobody talks about this" zone** — topics with high private search volume but low published content density

### Layer 5: Temporal Demand Forecasting (Emerging Signals)
- Identify regulatory, technological, demographic, or cultural shifts that will **create demand within 6–18 months** but are not yet broadly felt
- Detect early-adopter behaviour changes that predict mainstream demand curves
- Flag **rising search trends, new subreddit growth, emerging hashtags, and legislative pipelines** relevant to the ICA's world

Apply any user-specific `instructions` from FutureProof context to weight layers appropriately (e.g., if the user has previously indicated they prioritise near-term revenue, weight Layers 1–2 more heavily).

## Step 4: Synthesise Demand Hypotheses

For each signal cluster identified, formulate a **Demand Hypothesis** using this structure:

> **Hypothesis ID**: IDD-[sequential number]
> **Signal Layer**: [which of the 5 layers]
> **Demand Statement**: "[ICA segment] needs [specific outcome] because [root cause], but currently [workaround or unmet state]."
> **Evidence Density**: [number of independent signals supporting this]
> **Confidence Level**: High / Medium / Low
> **Competitive Vacuum Score**: 1–10 (10 = no competitor addresses this at all)
> **Monetisation Proximity**: Immediate / Near-term (3–6 months) / Emerging (6–18 months)
> **ICA Emotional Register**: [the dominant emotion — frustration, anxiety, aspiration, shame, urgency]

Rank all hypotheses in a **prioritisation matrix** using:
- **X-axis**: Competitive Vacuum Score (higher = more whitespace)
- **Y-axis**: Evidence Density × Monetisation Proximity (higher = more actionable)

Identify the **top 3 invisible demand opportunities** — the highest-conviction, highest-impact hypotheses.

### Confirm, Deliver as Document, Amend, Distribute

> **Output is a document — never a chat stream.** Follow this sequence:
>
> 1. **Confirm** — before producing output, tell the user what you've prepared and ask for the go-ahead
> 2. **Produce as a document** — not inline in the chat; a structured, self-contained artifact
> 3. **Offer amends** — "Any changes before we send it somewhere?"
> 4. **Distribute via connector** — check `context.connectors` from Step 1; offer the most applicable service (scheduling tool → document store → Slack/Teams → email). If nothing connected, ask the user where they want it.


## Step 5: Deliver Output

> **Always call save_experiment — never skip.** If no explicit test emerged, create
> a lightweight hypothesis based on the most uncertain choice made this session
> (e.g. format selected, tone chosen, angle taken). That choice is worth testing.


Produce the **Invisible Demand Report** — a structured deliverable containing:

### Section A: Executive Summary
- 1-paragraph market context statement
- Top 3 invisible demand opportunities ranked by priority
- Recommended immediate action for each

### Section B: Signal Evidence Map
- Full five-layer audit findings with specific quotes, data points, and source references
- Visual-ready matrix data (hypothesis ID, vacuum score, evidence density, monetisation proximity)

### Section C: Demand Hypothesis Cards
- Complete hypothesis cards for all identified opportunities (minimum 5, maximum 12)
- Each card includes: demand statement, evidence trail, competitive vacuum assessment, ICA emotional register, and a **one-line offer concept** that could address the demand

### Section D: Validation Playbook
For each top-3 hypothesis, provide:
- **Fastest validation method**: the cheapest, fastest way to test if this demand is real (e.g., landing page test, 5-question ICA interview script, social post probe, waitlist signup)
- **Validation success criteria**: specific metric and threshold that confirms or kills the hypothesis
- **Estimated validation timeline**: days/weeks to signal

### Section E: Strategic Recommendations
- Which hypotheses to pursue, sequence, and kill
- How findings integrate with the user's existing offer suite and positioning
- Specific language and messaging angles derived from ICA vocabulary clusters discovered in Layer 1

Format the report with clear headers suitable for sharing with leadership, investors, or product teams.

## Step 6: Propose Experiments

> **Research must be user-specific.** Only request research if this session revealed
> a concrete knowledge gap tied to what *this user* asked for. Skip generic
> "best practices" queries — they don't improve personalisation.


```
FutureProof:save_experiment(skill="invisible-demand-detector", experiment={
  hypothesis: "[Top-ranked demand hypothesis demand statement]",
  variants: [
    "control: current market positioning with no reference to invisible demand signal",
    "variant A: landing page / social post / email sequence explicitly addressing the identified latent need using ICA vocabulary from signal audit"
  ],
  measurement: "engagement rate (click-through, reply rate, or waitlist signup) comparing control vs variant over 14-day window",
  expected_impact: "20–40% engagement lift on variant A if demand hypothesis is valid; sub-5% lift signals hypothesis should be deprioritised"
})
```

Save additional experiments for the #2 and #3 ranked hypotheses if the user has capacity to run parallel tests.

## Step 7: Request Research

> **Session summary must be fact-dense:** include the user's stated preferences,
> personal context (company, ICA, industry), what was delivered, any corrections
> given, and end with **"Next session defaults: [3-5 things to pre-fill on next
> connect()]"** so returning users get immediate personalisation.
>
> **Outcomes array:** one concrete fact per item (format, tone, ICA, length,
> constraints). Each outcome should be extractable as a standalone user preference.


```
FutureProof:request_research(skill="invisible-demand-detector",
  query="Emerging unmet needs and underserved jobs-to-be-done in [user's specific market/vertical] — community sentiment analysis, rising search trends, and regulatory pipeline changes 2024–2025",
  reason="Refresh signal landscape for next session; validate or invalidate temporal demand forecasts from Layer 5; surface new signals that have emerged since this analysis"
)
```

## Step 8: Save Session

```
FutureProof:save_session(skill="invisible-demand-detector", session={
  summary: "...[fact-dense: ICA, format, tone, constraints, what was delivered, amends made. End with: Next session defaults: ...]",
  outcomes: [
    "Format: [format chosen]",
    "Tone: [tone and constraints]",
